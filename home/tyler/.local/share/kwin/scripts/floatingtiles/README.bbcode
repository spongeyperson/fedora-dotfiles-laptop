Makes windows non-overlapping, by automatically minimizing a window when it gets covered by another window, and optionally restoring it when space becomes available again.

[b]Please make sure to install the most recent version, and to not use Discover for installation. Please note the additional instructions for configuration on old Plasma versions.[/b] For more information on installation, configuration and usage as well as any requests, please visit [url=https://github.com/nclarius/floating-tiles]the GitHub page[/url].

This extension is intended to keep the workspace clutter-free while maximizing screen real estate and retain the user in full control over window and workspace management, aiming to combine the efficiency of a tiling layout with the flexibility of freely positionable floating windows. By default, any window that has been automatically minimized will be automatically restored once the space above it is free again; this can be disabled in the configuration. The windows to be affected can be filtered by window type and application.
